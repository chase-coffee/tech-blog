title:  "Wipe Windows 11 and use personal account"
---

## The setup

I had a Surface Laptop 3 that had been setting around for a while and I hadn't been using it. I'd already updated it to Windows 11 but had been working off a MacBook for a good amount and didn't need the Surface anymore.

My brother is trying to get into the networking but his current computer is a little under the weather due to a well known computer issue called having young children. I decided to give him the laptop as an antidote to his current issue but it needed to be wiped and set up under his account. 

Wiping it went without a hitch. However, setting it up under his personal account? Not so much.

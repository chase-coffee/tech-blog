# tech writing

Hello! My name is Chase and I'm a Product Manager at Microsoft.

This isn't related to my work there. Well it could be but that's not the purpose for this. 
See, I've worked in tech for about 10 years but I'm still learning a ton. It's not really focused on anything specific, more just what I'm currently interested in. A good way to reenforce that learning is to write about it or teach it so this is really just a hodge-podge of things I've learned and hope that it can give you a little value as well.

Feel free to let me know what you think!
